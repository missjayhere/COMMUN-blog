            <h3>CHECK OUT OUR TOP SUMMER ACCESSORIES MUST HAVES</h3>
            <h4>1. STATEMENT SUNGLASSES</h4>
            <p>Sunnies are a powerful accessory—they’re the first thing people see when they're talking to you. They also have the power to instantly pull a look together on both low-key and more-dressy days alike. Oversized sunglasses provide the ultimate finishing touch—whether it's with a casual ensemble for off-duty occasions or a bold swimsuit for poolside sunbathing. Plus, they’re the perfect accessory for those no-makeup days. We recommend having multiple sunnies ready to fit the mood and outfit of the day. Find out more about which trending sunglasses work best for each face shape and the season’s top arrivals.

            <h5>2. LIGHTWEIGHT SCARVES</h5>
            <p>There’s a certain je ne sais quoi about wearing a printed silk scarf. A nod to French-girl style, they look effortlessly chic wrapped around the wrist, a ponytail or bun, the neck, or even around the handle of a bag. A scarf in a detailed print and punchy colors can elevate even the simplest of summer outfits, like a tank top and denim shorts. While they may not be the first summer accessory that comes to mind, a silk scarf is so lightweight that even on the hottest days, it won’t be bothersome, especially tied around your hair. Plus, they’re an easy accessory to grab on the way out the door and finish tying on in mere seconds before arriving at your destination.</p>
